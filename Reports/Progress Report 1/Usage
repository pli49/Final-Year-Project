The fourth phase is usage. This is the stage where the devices are in use in offices. The needs of the LIMPETs must be addressed in this stage. The needs can be broken down into operational requirements and maintenance. The operational requirements outline the resources required to function the LIMPETs. The main one being power usage. The devices are battery-powered. The battery used is a Li_Ion battery which has an approximate lifespan of 3 years (https://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/tektronix/LIBMG.pdf). This is advantageous as the device will be sourcing power from a stored supply for its lifespan. The batter will most likely be unreplaceable as it will require the opening and refitting of the design. This has both negative and positive impacts. The use of a battery is good as it does not impact the environment over its lifetime, but also the lifetime is not as long as it would be it was powered via mains. The devices also impact the energy usage of the overall office they are within. As the LIMPETs indicate the use of specific desks and areas, the power distribution within the office can be optimised. Things like air conditioning, computers and lighting can be distributed based on the usage of certain areas in the office, which the LIMPETs can now monitor. This reduces energy usage across the whole office, which positively affects the environmentâ€”finally, the repair and maintenance of the device. If the device starts to malfunction or requires repairs, it will be most likely be replaced, as the repair of such devices incurs more cost than a straight replacement. A repair would require two-way postage between the supplier and user and then need someone to work hours to diagnose and repair the LIMPETs. It is far more effective to replace the part, requiring one-way postage and no work hours spent repairing.
